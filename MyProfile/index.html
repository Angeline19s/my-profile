				<p>
				Originally from Colmar, a town of 70 000 inhabitants in Alsace, and freshly graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economic and Social Sciences, I am currently in my first year in the Grande Ã‰cole Program at IESEG School of Management.
				The qualities that correspond to me are rigor, creativity, dynamism and ambition. I like to defend my ideas and debate on a variety of topics, following my enrollment in a debate club in high school.
				I visited thirteen countries, which made me curious and open-minded. I like to travel a lot because it is for me, an enriching knowledge. I have also been playing piano since I was 4 years old. I was also a member of a ski club for several years.

				<h2>Skiing, a passion</h2>
				<p>
				Skiing has been my favorite sport since I was a kid. I do it for pleasure, but I still won the gold star. I was part of a club in my town called ASPTT Colmar Ski. We went skiing every Saturday and during the holidays with all my friends from the club.

				<h2>Playing Piano</h2>
				<p>I have been playing the piano since I was 4 years old and I also studied music theory. I graduated from cycle 1 and 2 in piano and music theory. I also love to listen to the piano at work, it's relaxing.

				<h2>Travelling in the world</h2>
				<p>Traveling and discovering new countries and cultures is essential and very rewarding. Having been to over 13 countries, whether on family trips or with local families, it's always a great way to learn a new language.
